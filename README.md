# GRBL - fork for Polargraph (wall draw bot)
This is a fork of a fork of GRBL designed for a custom version of a Polargraph wall draw bot.
I forget the details as I'm writing this nearly a year after the fact, but essentially all I did was remap some pins to accomodate a different version of the stepper motor control board. We used UGS to control the drawing, and honestly the results weren't half bad.
This code was installed and run for my final Electronics and Robotics project, which I completed together with Eyad Mekki, who did most of the physical design of the robot.
